- Invite the right people using invitations.
- Invite people as readers to share without adding chatter. Readers can browse messages and add reactions and comments.
- Invite people as contributors and they can post new messages to the scrapbook. They can also edit and delete their messages.
Share events, topics or just life using a Patchr scrapbook.
