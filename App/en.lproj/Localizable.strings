Some sharing apps can overshare making it hard to tell if messages and photos are shared with just the right people. Patchr stops oversharing with private invitations that let you control who can see messages and how they can participate:
- Invite the right people using invitations.
- Invite people as readers to share without adding chatter. Readers can browse messages and add reactions and comments.
- Invite people as contributors and they can post new messages to the channel. They can also edit and delete their messages.
Share events, topics or just life using a Patchr channel.
Patchr has brilliant messaging features: photo search and editing, reactions, comments, realtime notifications, offline posting plus much more.
Invite members from your contacts and we handle the rest! We email them an invitation, help them install Patchr and gently launch them into your amazing channel.";
